# Todoist-Social-Accountability
Using crontab, this will post an end-of-day progress report to Twitter. It could probably be repurposed for other things, as well.

# To-dos:
* Fix tweet lengths -- the emoji I'm using in the tweets count extra against the tweet length limit and I should have accounted for that.

# Learnings:
* Todoist is great but their API drives me batshit crazy
* there's got to be a better way to handle datetime operations in python
* emoji count as multiple characters; I knew this, but I didn't _know_ this...ugh
