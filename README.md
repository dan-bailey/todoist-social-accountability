# Todoist-Social-Accountability
Using crontab, this will post an end-of-day progress report to Twitter. It could probably be repurposed for other things, as well.

# To-dos:
* filter list of items so it just shows today's stuff
* build list for posting to Twitter (break up if over char limit)
* connect to Twitter account
* make post
* install this on my lightweight linux box and set up a cron job

# Learnings:
* Todoist is great but their API drives me batshit crazy
