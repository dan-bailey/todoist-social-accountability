# Todoist-Social-Accountability
Using crontab, this will post an end-of-day progress report to Twitter. It could probably be repurposed for other things, as well.

# To-dos:
* configure so it breaks up posts that are too long
* install this on my lightweight linux box and set up a cron job

# Learnings:
* Todoist is great but their API drives me batshit crazy
